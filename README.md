## Snake Game
# Work in Progress - Snake

## Introduction to Project

\*\* This project is the first Hackathon started on 29/1/2026. The focus on this project was to gain valuable experience of collaboration, working with multi-users on GitHub, and to create a working project which satisfies the working criteria namely, to create a one page product which is interactive.

** The team members were: Jordan, Dave, Michael, Eki and Dominic\_**

** In the first instance a meeting was held where ideas were shared about the project and . It was decided that a retro game would be produced and updated using current programming frameworks and techniques.\_**

** The game chosen was the Nokia classic "Snake"**
** This project is a modern recreation of the classic Snake game, built for learning and experimentation.**

** The main purpose of the website is to give the user a taste of the mobile phone games which were prevelant in the mid to late 1900's.**

3. A background image was generated using AI
4. Modification of the team members' photographs.
5. Use of AI to help with git pull and merge issues encountered.
6. During the design process, AI has been used by each team member either to debug code or generate code.
