# Work in Progress - Snake

## Introduction to Project

\*\* This project is the first Hackathon started on 29/1/2026. The focus on this project was to gain valuable experience of collaboration, working with multi-users on GitHub, and to create a working project which satisfies the working criteria namely, to create a one page product which is interactive.

** The team members were: Jordan, Dave, Michael, Eki and Dominic\_**

** In the first instance a meeting was held where ideas were shared about the project and . It was decided that a retro game would be produced and updated using current programming frameworks and techniques.\_**

** The game chosen was the Nokia classic "Snake"**
** This project is a modern recreation of the classic Snake game, built for learning and experimentation.**

** The main purpose of the website is to give the user a taste of the mobile phone games which were prevelant in the mid to late 1900's.**
